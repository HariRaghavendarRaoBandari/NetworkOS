### The State of NFV Research: An Academic Perspective

Amy Apon | Chair, Computer Science Division | Clemson University
Program Director | National Science Foundation

Jason Anderson | PhD Student | Clemson University

cpu, gpu, FPGA, ...
NAT, FW, LB, Encryption

Virtual Firewall-VNGuard
Container, ClickCT, ClickOS, 

Needs:

* performance, scalable, Reliable
* energy efficient
* secure
* managable

Future: 

* softwarization will remove the border network and what is connected to it, 
* more powerful end device, node, dynamics platforms,
* multitude of device, compoentte, logical

persistance technology: new opportunity 

### NFV Integration and Orchestration for Resource Automation within Hybrid Cloud Environments

Robert Cannistra | Senior Professional Lecturer of Computer Science and Information Technology | Marist College
Innovation Lab

SDI (Software Defined Infrastructure), Infrastructure Pattern, Software Pattern, Solution. 
Self-service (provisioning, )

Cloud Optimization:

- **translate lagacy protocol to OpenFlow** 
- Elastic
- Flow Optimization, 

**predictive Analytics**

Getting data from various places for analytics is hard, need taps.

### Open, Elastic Provisioning of Hardware Acceleration in NFV Environments

Leonhard Nobach | Scientist | Technische Universität Darmstadt

* Virtualziation has overhead
* competting with hardware acceleration
* Scale out
* ClickOS and ClickCT

Combining virtualization with network-attached acceleration
AH (Acceleration Hardware)ASICs, FPGA, NPU, GPU

use NPU for Simple Use Case 
use AH for Complex Use Case 

define simple/complex for difference use cases, very useful information.
<<insert architecture diagram here>>
flexibility is more important.

Need Description languages for certain groups of hardware
ODP, GDP, DPDK, ...
Stay out of hypervisor for better performance

### Self-service VPN for enterprise branches for secure connectivity to cloud applications
Sriram Natarajan | Senior Research Engineer | Deutsche Telekom T-Labs

* **Need Dynamicicity and Service Velocity**
* **Value: easy access, easy connect, easy create service**

### Developing for practical deployment – Latest research from nfvrg
Ramki Krishnan | Co-Chair nfvrg | IETF
Distinguished Engineer, CTO NFV | Dell

NFV is difference from virtualizing DC/cloud.
Policy driven, 
Modeling overlap with policy, information, data model. 

### Architecting for E2E performance: Enhanced Platform
Awareness and VNF modelling for predictable deployment
Francisco-Javier Ramón | Head of Network Virtualisation Initiative and NFV Reference Lab, GCTO Unit | Telefónica I+D

Need to properly divide the responsibility of HW and SW to maximize the strength of each component. 

EPA

Need to find out how to map high level intent to lower layer implementation.

### NFV-VITAL: Characterizing the Performance of Virtual Network Functions
Puneet Sharma | Principal Research Scientist | HP Labs

* Clearwater (IMS-VNF) case-study
* Capacity is related to a given configuration
* Performance and OSS is related to the usage

virtualize information modeling from physical database.

## Day-1

### KEYNOTE – SDN+NFV Next Steps in the JourneyMargaret Chiosi | Distinguished Network Architect | AT&T Labs President | OPNFV
Controller is like actuator for that function.
Global controller, local controller (data center, leaf and spine controller), WAM controller. 
Service Orchestrator and network orchestrator,
by separating of concerns. Model driven, OSS/BSS are part of design. 
multi-tenancy at server level
coordination among controllers

### NFV – an engine of innovation for CSPs
Saar Gillai | SVP, GM of NFV Business Unit and Global Telecommunications Business Lead | HP

Decoupling -> standardize
virtualize -> better utilization
Cloudify -> elasticity and speed
Decompose -> Commposable services

Ecosystem 
If you cannot orchestrate, you can not operate.
Bridge new & existing
Operational change requires cultural change
99.999 is still mis-understood, we are still talk about motivation, spiration, and visions.

### Managing the Paradigm shift to NFVBhaskar Gorti | President of IP Platforms | Alcatel-Lucent
Agility, timeline changed, fast fail over and recover

### Panel discussion
* **Challenges**
	* when and how to disconnect the old technologies, while adapt the new one.
	* transform from vertical to horizontal is different thinking/working relationship.
* **Ecosystem**
	* many companies focus on their specialities.
	* learning from others, be ready to change.
	* need to move and partnership to work together.
* **Openness**
	* open source, low IP, there place for plugin
	* openness in relationship.
* **Competing ecosystems**
	* implementable now.
	* avoid duplication.

## Day-2      

### Opening Address: KEYNOTES – MAKING NFV A REALITY AND MAKING NFV OPENDana Cooperson | Research Director | Analysys Mason* it requires clear business goals and  deployment strategies
	* Service-led
	* IT architectdure migration
### Lowering entry barriers with NFV Orchestration: OpenMANO from Telefónica's NFV Reference LabFrancisco-Javier Ramón | Head of Network Virtualisation Initiative and NFV Reference Lab, GCTO Unit | Telefónica I+D

### An End-to-end NFV Solution Including all Components of the ETSI NFV Reference ModelEyal Felstaine | VP, Head of NG OSS and Network Cloud Service Orchestrator | Amdocs

vCPE PoC with Junpier

Service Fulfilment consists of all 5 TMN layers.
Incremental adjustment of fulfilment and assurance per monitoring feedback.

Describe the desired state (SLA) and current state. 
Orchestration is for IaaS and PaaS, SaaS is self-service. 
Although automation is generally automate the manual process, look into the options, sometimes, the automation itself presents the solution different from manual methods. 

### Making NFV a Reality: Practical Considerations for an Open FutureArpit Joshipura | VP, Product Mgmt & Marketing, Dell Networking & NFV | Dell 
1. Learning from software enterprise (convergence of network and IT), 
2. Establish common ground technology ground, combine CIO and CTO, fold TMN model to half, flatten the world, systems, layers.3. Adopt the right architecture and use cases
4. Solve the organiation issue strategically, software defined people
5. Determine your appetite for 'open', openness is new properitary. 

Bring the high-end product to mass. 
New opportunity, new competition, new ecosystem. 
Ourselves are part of system/ecosystem.

### KEYNOTE – Cloudifying the Network for D2.0 
Toby Ford | AVP | AT&TMember, Board of Directors | OpenStack Foundation
**Cloudifying** scale, flexible software, 
distributed resources to get resilence, which requires more automation.
learning from Amazon and Google.
75% SDN/NFV more modular, API driven, less people to support services
CPU helps the switch the traffic.
Distance of fiber can go even further.

To Cloudify:

* to virtualization or containerize or ..
* to automate fully
* to externialize thru API exposure
* to distribute
* to horizationally scale
* to make perfect from the imperfect

### KEYNOTE – OPENJim Zemlin | Executive Director | Linux Foundation
* business model* secure, 
* problems: not enough resource, GnuPG Author: Going Brook, OpenSSL: less then $2000, CII (core infrastructure inititive) project, (sourcing, best practise,..) as trainer and supporter.

### Foreseeing the Future of NFV Through Advanced Use CasesMark Bieberich | Senior Director of Strategy for SDN/NFV Solutions | NEC/NetCracker

Product does follow the bell curve, it is more like shark-fin

* Mobile Enterprise
* Customized Residential Broadband, mobile service does not work mobile business. Policy management can help.
* Improving the MVNO Model

**reduce the cost of de-commissioning a service**
