# ONS Workshop

Market is growing, traffic is growing, but revenue is not in same curve.
IP companies is taking the lead, telecom has to speed up the development.
Open source is the way to go. 

Google, Amazon, and MSFT are doing in the full stack. We are moving too slow, 

White Box and Open Source is the way to go. 

## Panel-1 Service Provider Network

Scott - Acadamic Prospective
Conceptual Barriers to Deployment

### SDN is from Mars, NFV is from Venus

Traffic class mapped to pipeline, 
Edge to edge requirement 
 
### Common Framework 

Learning from Map-Reduce
DAG
Create an instance graph
Scale up/down depending on load
Failure, need HA, rollback, 

Use Case.

SLA 
mult VNF access the same cache. 

summary
follow Berkeley

Manage VNF at edge
Carrier should emulate the cloud
service virtualization, application 

unify SDN and NFV
use famework for NFV
enable third-party service in carriers

#### Amit
from Google
- need to improve whole system
- System upgrade needs to be transparent
- expose NFV to external customers

Onix 

vertical integrated - IBM, DEC, HP, NCR

Cluster Computing as a Parallel
Software defined Clusters?

#### Al Blackburn
open our network - modular
simplfy and scale our network - new operational ECOMP
increase value of network - Agile, Elastic Dynamic improving cycle time.

deliver AIC, vitualization plan, SDN-C plan, Automation. 
Disaggregation, Modularity, performance and elasticity
ONOS-Access, Optical and Spine/leaf

#### NTT
Orchestrator, SDN controller, SDN node (APGW) 
Reduce box types

#### NEC
Requirements- auto-scalaing, self-healing, service velocity & time to revenue, service chaining, and composition

Object-defined network orchestration
=> goal oriented meta model

## Panel-2

Nick
- baremetal 
- software eats the world
- Open source is essential and non-differential

P4 forwarding plane
OCP - 
ONF
ONOS

#### Things learned in open source

Develop Non-differentiated plumbing
- community building, cross community
- *code* is the coin of the realm, there are other items, Doc, getting involve
- Engineering systems are as important as artifacts, use Google Hangout
- hyper-scale -> Enginnering systems, Culture, people/process How to build it is important.
- Open source transform good-cheap-fast to fast-fast-fast
- Software define intelligence

#### OS from Cumulus
- open source *x ?= y* industry standard
- open source *x ?= y* transparency, license
- open source *x ?= y* continuity of supply, many to many suppliers
- open source *x ?= y* shared liability
- open source *x ?= y* studious minds

Core vs Context for Service Providers
- certain technologies drive your business- edge service, oss/bss
- other technologies help you get there
- Own core pieces and truely understand context

SAI (open compute platform) from Cumulus answer is abstract. 

#### ONOS
- SDN OS for Service Provider Network
- Distributed Core
- Patterns 
- Application Intent Framework

#### Chip
- Switch OS should be protocol agnostic.
- Demand with feedback from OS
- Central Office Data Center

Fully programmable forwarding plane
- Unshackled
- Software defined
- Protocol agnostic 

see p4.org

- combine multi-switches into one cluster.

## Panel-3 Migration from Legacy to Pure Play SDN/NFV
Dan Pitt, Executive Director, ONF

#### Kevin from Ciena
- User defined cloud
- Value Proposition
- Open Interfaces with Netconf YANG, and mediation => multi-vendor equipment 
- Maintain App befefit during control system evolution , one control > multiple
- Automation => effiency
- move NFV to edge with SDN, merge

#### Dave From Ward, Cisco 
ConfD modeling tool

#### Verizon
Parallel, grouping controllers

## Panel-4 SDN/NFV
#### Microsoft
- host SDN, System SDN, Device SDN
- defect and software bugs happen.

#### Netcrack
- analytics -> policy -> orchestration -> operating device -> data collection

#### 
- analytics -> recommendation
- Global and Application level visibility and control is critical
