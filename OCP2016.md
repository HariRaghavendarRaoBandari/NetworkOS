# OCP2016@SanJose
20160309@SanJoseConvensionCenter


## Day-1
#### key-notes
Nothing special, they just said OCP is important.

#### Panel Discussion:  

* why whitebox - cost reduction, fast innovation, source independency 
* challenge is on softwre, it is more like app now
* automation
* edge computing enable the customization.
* customizing for special use case, or individual
* different types of traffic will be riding on the same network.  
* tradition telecom: close relationship with equipment vendors, closed and protected space. new role: part of integration team.
* current approach: software skill, learning skill
* DevOps concept culture inserts into telecom industry.

#### Facebook:

* AI hardware, self-driving car, medical research,..
* 80% of FB users lives outside of North America

#### Google:

join OCP today and contribute 48dcv standard and propose a narrower rack form factor

#### Microsoft

* contributes SONiC

## Day-2

#### Transforming Networks to an All-IT based Infrastructure with OCP and Open Networking   
from SK telecom  
* All IT-Network (programmability, open HW and SW, SDN/NFV)
* virtualization all HW

* use FB Wedge 
* porting Indigo on wedge + ONL (dependency in ASIC Kernel SDK)

#### ToRC â€“ Applications, Microservices, and VNFs controlled by the Top-of-Rack Switch

* control is moving to center of network, **enterprise-wide OS**
* interesting things are moving to edge, need process fast,
* Docker, mesos, fboss, opensl, onl, openBmc, Calico

**very good work/presentation from ATT Foundry**

#### SONiC

* network software components
* builds on tyoe of SAI
* provide L2/L3 functionalities
* loosely-coupled modular design
* separate states and logic

Production ready stack
