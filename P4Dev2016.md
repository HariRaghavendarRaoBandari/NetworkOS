Per your instruction I attended the first P4 meeting with Margret about 1 year ago. Even it was a long shot, we recommended to support this open source activity. P4 has made good progress. I attended the third P4 workshop and hands on training last week. The hands on training allows me better appreciate the impact of this technology.

More detailed random notes are attached with this email, my comments are as follows:* Although the original intent of P4 is to provide a common programming language for switch, the language may extends to other areas/layers: like control plane and define interfaces to VPP and DPDK. P4 may extend to OCP (Open Compute Platform) space.* If we are willing to take risk, P4 is ready to build a fully function switch by using part of Microsoft SONiC with Netronome's IDE (it is very usable, but not open source)* In long term, ML can play a role in parser design.* P4 provides auto API generation, this opens the door for interface with OASIS TOSCA. 
# P4 Language 2016sponsored by Netronome, Barefoot Network, AT&T       Richard Kuo, 20160523 at Stanford, CA## Tutorial ### keynoteNick McKwoqn from Stanford    P4 is formal language to define the switch function at forwarding plane.   the intent is to define a common language to describe the operation and logic for multiple platform and be able to move switch hardware to software   abstraction the purpose of hardwarehopefully this => better network (isolation, security)   question from audience: Why forwarding plane only?   How about control plane? It is not very clear at this point.my comment: P4 can easily cover other layers.### End UnserPatrick OSullivan, Goldman Sachs   no message! talking in circle, wasted everyone's time.### P4.org OverviewPrem from Barefoot NetworkOpenvSwitch    Sonic by Microsoftfboss by facebookswitch.p4switchAPIswitchlink to run control planeswitchSAI - [Packet Test Framework(PTF)][From OFReferenceTest ][2]:The original test framework for OpenFlow was done in Perl. The structure of the tests was quite static and focused on testing the NetFPGA 4-port design. It was considered difficult to add new tests and to target other platforms.There is a good [DPDK test framework][4] can be leveraged for network performance textp4-> OVS   p4-> BMv2    CCF ([China Compute Federation][1]) started some activities around this area too.### P4 Language Tutorial -
